# SeatWise - Frontend (React)

The administrative portal for SeatWise, built with React and optimized for high-performance seating visualization and layout management.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The interface follows a **Modern Glassmorphism** aesthetic, designed to provide a premium, professional experience for educational administrators.

- **Glassy Navbar**: Subtle, transparent navigation boundaries that blend with the backdrop-blur effect.
- **Dynamic Grid**: A high-fidelity seating visualization that handles 200+ students per room with zero lag.
- **Micro-Animations**: Smooth transitions powered by GSAP and Framer Motion for enhanced user feedback.
